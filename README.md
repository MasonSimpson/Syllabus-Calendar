This is my submission for the LawBandit Software Engineering internship. This program allows the user to upload a syllabus from one of their courses. An AI will parse through the uploaded document and generate a clean looking calendar that displays all assignments in that course with their due date.

I'm going to be honest, this project was hard. While I had experience with TypeScript and Node.js there was a lot of learning involved as I had never worked with AI before (you can see that in my code - the prompt I use to generate the data isn't very efficient). I believe this project demonstrates not only my technical abilities, but my willingness to learn quickly on the job and adapt to new technologies. 

I'm thankful for the opportunity to work on this project, and hope that the people of LawBandit enjoy looking through my program!
